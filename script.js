/*

// Coventions to name variables
// 1. Camel case - start with a lower case alphabet for first word of the variable and all first alphabets of subsequent words are capitalised
// 2. If we have more than one word for naming a vairable, we can seperate the two words by underscore. It is called KEBAB CASE
// 3. We can not use first letter of the variable as a numerical value. It will be a syntax error.
// 4. Variables in JS can only contain letters, numbers, underscore and dollar sign.
// 5. We can not name a vriable with the name which is a reserved JS keyword such as new, function etc.
// 6. underscore and dollar sign are the two letters that can be used as the first letter of variables
// 7. We should not name the variable with the uppercase letter as this is a convention in JS. More about it latter.
// 8. VARIABLES NAMES SHOULD BE TOTALLY DESCRIPTIVE

// a. numebr (these are floating point numbers)

// c. boolean (logical type true or false)
// d. undefined (value of a vairable that is only declared but value is not assigend i.e. variable is not defined)
// e. null (when we explicitly set the variable's value to null)
// symbol (value that is unique and cannot be changed)
// f. BigInt (lareger intergers)

let age = 30;

// We can reassign value to a vriable using let keyword

// const keyword is used to declare a variable whose value can not be changed. These variables can not be just declares. A value has to be assigend to these variables. Otherwise we will get TypeError ot syntax error

const birthYear = 1990;

// var is old way of defining variables but this convention of declaring variables should be completely avoided.

// The plus operator can also be used with two strings to join them (concatenations)
const firstName = "Newton";
const lastName = "Flips";
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
// There is a better way to concatenate stings i.e. to use the template strings. It will be covered a bit latter

// Assignment operators
let x = 10 + 5;

// The equals sign above is an assignment operator.
x += 10;
console.log(x);

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰
